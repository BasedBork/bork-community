## About Bots

Unlike skills or hooks that extend Claude Code, bots are complete standalone applications. They're ready to deploy and use independently.

### Contributing a Bot

To add your bot:

1. Create a folder in `tools/bots/your-bot-name/`
2. Include a comprehensive README with:
   - What the bot does
   - How to set it up
   - How to deploy it
3. Include all source code and configuration
4. Don't include secrets, API keys, or personal data
