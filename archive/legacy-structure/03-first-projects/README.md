# First Projects

Build something real with Claude Code.

## Why Build Projects?

Reading documentation is one thing. Building something is how you actually learn. These tutorials take you from blank folder to working project.

## Choose Your Project

| Project | Difficulty | What You'll Build | Time |
|---------|------------|-------------------|------|
| [Landing Page](./landing-page/) | Beginner | Static HTML/CSS site | 30 min |
| [Todo App](./todo-app/) | Intermediate | Next.js + local storage | 1 hr |
| [CLI Tool](./cli-tool/) | Intermediate | Node.js command-line tool | 45 min |
| [API Wrapper](./api-wrapper/) | Intermediate | Python API client | 45 min |

## Recommended Path

**New to coding?**
1. Start with [Landing Page](./landing-page/) - no frameworks, just HTML/CSS
2. Then try [Todo App](./todo-app/) - introduces React and state

**Already code but new to Claude Code?**
1. Pick the project closest to your usual work
2. Focus on Claude Code workflow, not the tech

## What You'll Learn

Each tutorial covers:

- **Planning with Claude**: Using plan mode to scope the project
- **Iterating**: Building feature by feature
- **Debugging**: When things go wrong (they will)
- **Shipping**: Getting it deployed

## Before You Start

Make sure you've:
- [ ] [Installed Claude Code](../00-getting-started/INSTALL.md)
- [ ] Completed your [first session](../00-getting-started/FIRST_SESSION.md)
- [ ] Understand [plan mode](../01-core-concepts/PLAN_MODE.md)

## Project Philosophy

These tutorials are intentionally simple. The goal isn't to build production apps—it's to learn the Claude Code workflow:

```
Idea → Plan → Build → Iterate → Ship
```

Once you've done this loop a few times, you can apply it to anything.
