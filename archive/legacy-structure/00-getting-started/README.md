# Getting Started with Claude Code

Your path from zero to vibe coding in 15 minutes.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a CLI tool that brings Claude directly into your terminal. Point it at any codebase and start building with natural language.

Think of it as an AI pair programmer that:
- Reads and understands your entire codebase
- Writes, edits, and refactors code
- Runs commands and manages files
- Explains code and answers questions

## Prerequisites

- **Claude subscription**: Pro ($20/mo), Max ($100-200/mo), or API credits
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Terminal access**: macOS Terminal, Windows PowerShell, or Linux shell

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Navigate to any project
cd your-project

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

That's it. You're in.
