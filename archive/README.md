# Archive

This directory contains the legacy numbered directory structure, preserved for backwards compatibility with existing links.

## What's Here

## Why Keep This?

- Existing links and documentation may reference old paths
- Some content (first-projects, deployment, community) wasn't migrated to the main structure
- Provides a reference for contributors who knew the old layout

## Don't Link Here

New documentation should link to the main structure:
- `quick-start/` not `archive/legacy-structure/00-getting-started/`
- `tools/skills/` not `archive/legacy-structure/05-skills/`
- `best-practices/` not `archive/legacy-structure/01-core-concepts/`
